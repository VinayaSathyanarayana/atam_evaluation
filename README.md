# Introduction
The Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM) is a method for evaluating software architectures relative to quality attribute goals. 
Method evaluations expose architectural risks that potentially inhibit the achievement of an organizationâ€™s business goals. 

`Architecture_Evaluation_Form_Template_V0.ods` open sheet document is a tool developed based on [ATAM](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=513908).
This document can be used within the process defined for ATAM. ATAM process participants can complete this document in applicable steps while the ATAM process mentioned in [ATAM](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=513908).

Step 5. Generate quality attribute utility tree. The open sheet has the most quality attributes that are commonly found in modern software applications. These can be found under `User Perspective` and `Developer Perspective`sheets. ATAM participants should update none applicable `Quality Attributes` in `User Perspective` and `Developer Perspective` sheets under `Priority` column `NA` and `Evaluation` column `Non-Risk`.
Step 6. Analyze architectural approaches. During this step, `Non-Risks`, architectural `risks`, `sensitivity points`, and `tradeoff` detail points are identified and added under the each `Quality Attribute` / `evaluation` (column). The sheet provides some samples of possible areas to evaluate under each quality attribute.
Step 7. Brainstorm and prioritise scenarios. During this step, a priority is assigned to each detail point. Use column `Priority` and select between `HIGH` to `LOW`.
Step 8. Analyze architectural approaches. This step reiterates the activities of Step 6. The participants should modify the open sheet accordingly. See more details on [ATAM](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=513908).
Step 9. Present results. Final qualifier will be presented on `Summary` sheet. `risks`, `sensitivity points`, and `tradeoff` to be fixed be available on `User Perspective` and `Developer Perspective`sheets.

See `Lists` sheet for descriptions and rank values for summary calculations.
